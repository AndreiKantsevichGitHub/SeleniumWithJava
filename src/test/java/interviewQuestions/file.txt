    --- Methods of handling authentication window in selenium webdriver ---

  We can handle basic authentication in 4 ways:

 1. Passing username and password along with the url
  driver.get(“http://UserName:Password@ankpro.com”)
 2. alert.setAuthenticationCredentials method.
  driver.switchTo().alert().setAuthenticationCredentials(“username”, ” password”)
 3. Using SendKeys
  alert.sendKeys( "username" + Keys.Tab + "password" + Keys.Tab); alert.accept();
 4. We can use the third party automation tools like AutoIt or Sikuli for sending
 the keys to this window.

  The approach to handle authentication window popup may be different in each browser,
try any one of mentioned method.
  In case your authentication server requires username with domain like "domainuser"
you need to add double slash  to the url:
 domain_nameuser:password@example.com
  If your username or password is having @ symbol then replace it with %40
